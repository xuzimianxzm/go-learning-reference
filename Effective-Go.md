## Formatting

The go provides the commands program of gofmt to formatting the go code style.
which operates at the package level rather than source file level.

```shell
go fmt
```

## Commentary

Go provides C-style /\* \*/ block comments and C++-style // line comments.

- Every package should have a package comment,a block comment preceding the package clause.
- For multi-file packages, the package comment only needs to be present in one file, and any one will do.
- If the package is simple, the package comment can be brief.
- Every exported (capitalized) name in a program should have a doc comment.
- The first sentence should be a one-sentence summary that starts with the name being declared.

If every doc comment begins with the name of the item it describes, you can use the doc subcommand of the go tool and run the output through grep.

```shell
go doc -all regexp | grep -i item-name
```

## Package names

Notes: Don't use the import . notation, which can simplify tests that must run outside the package they are testing, but should otherwise be avoided.

## Interface names

- one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification to construct an agent noun: Reader, Writer, Formatter, CloseNotifier etc.

## Named result parameters

The return or result "parameters" of a Go function can be given names and used as regular variables, just like the incoming parameters. When named, they are initialized to the zero values for their types when the function begins; if the function executes a return statement with no arguments, the current values of the result parameters are used as the returned values.

```go
func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {
    for len(buf) > 0 && err == nil {
        var nr int
        nr, err = r.Read(buf)
        n += nr
        buf = buf[nr:]
    }
    return
}
```

## Defer

Go's defer statement schedules a function call (the deferred function) to be run immediately before the function executing the defer returns. It's an unusual but effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be released regardless of which path a function takes to return. The canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.

```go
// Contents returns the file's contents as a string.
func Contents(filename string) (string, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer f.Close()  // f.Close will run when we're finished.

    var result []byte
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    for {
        n, err := f.Read(buf[0:])
        result = append(result, buf[0:n]...) // append is discussed later.
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
            return "", err  // f will be closed if we return here.
        }
    }
    return string(result), nil // f will be closed if we return here.
}
```

Deferring a call to a function such as Close has two advantages. First, it guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake that's easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return path. Second, it means that the close sits near the open, which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.

The arguments to the deferred function (which include the receiver if the function is a method) are evaluated when the defer executes, not when the call executes. Besides avoiding worries about variables changing values as the function executes, this means that a single deferred call site can defer multiple function executions. Here's a silly example.

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    defer fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
}
```

Deferred functions are executed in LIFO order, so this code will cause 4 3 2 1 0 to be printed when the function returns.
